ShapeMixer
==========

Description:
-------------
ShapeMixer is an interactive OpenGL application using wxWidgets. It demonstrates a simple use of the
factory design pattern to create three shapes (Rectangle, Triangle, Circle) and allows you to control 
their appearance. A control panel provides three checkboxes to toggle each shape’s visibility and three
sliders to adjust the scene’s translation and rotation. An overlay button on the OpenGL canvas
toggles the visibility of the control panel.
