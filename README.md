# ShapeMixer

## Description
ShapeMixer is an interactive OpenGL application built with wxWidgets that demonstrates the integration of modern UI controls with real-time 2D graphics rendering. The application implements a **factory design pattern** for shape management, providing a scalable foundation for adding new shapes without modifying existing code. This design choice allows for easy application extension with new geometric primitives while maintaining a clean separation of concerns.

## Key Features
- A `wxGLCanvas`-based OpenGL rendering system that displays four distinct shapes: **Triangle, Square, Circle, and Julia Fractal**
- A transparent **overlay button** rendered directly in the OpenGL context, providing seamless integration with the 2D scene
- A dynamic control panel with intuitive UI elements:
  - Shape toggles using `wxCheckBox` controls
  - Precise position control through horizontal and vertical `wxSliders`
  - Scale adjustment via a dedicated `wxSlider`
  - A **Clear All** button for quick scene reset
- Robust event handling system that manages:
  - Mouse interactions with the overlay button
  - Window resizing events
  - Control panel visibility toggling
  - Real-time shape transformations

---

## Technical Implementation
- Factory pattern implementation for shape creation and management
- Proper OpenGL context handling throughout the application lifecycle
- Efficient resource management with **RAII** principles
- Clean separation between UI controls and rendering logic
- Responsive event handling system for smooth user interaction

---

## Demonstrated Concepts
- Modern C++ design patterns in graphics applications
- Integration of **wxWidgets** with **OpenGL**
- Real-time 2D graphics rendering and event-driven programming
- UI/UX design principles for desktop apps
